<h2><a id='but_why'>But why?</a></h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Why go through all of this trouble?  Why not just use Unity?  Why does this site look so weird?
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy putting together retro-pixel graphics games.  8-bit stuff.  That's surprisingly
        hard to do with a tool like Unity.  Even modern tools designed for 2D game work expect
        you to want a full 4K resolution with infinite colors and 1024x1024 sprites.  And the
        resulting redistributable files are huge.  It's all overkill for what I enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was previously working on a C++/SDL2 framework to build my games with,
        but I can only build on Windows and Linux.  What about my Apple and Android
        friends?  Luckily for us almost anything can run a website these days.  I'll be
        creating a series of demo pages here, each hopefully a little more complex than the
        one before.  Maybe in a couple of weeks we'll have some games to play here!

    <a href='games/xor.html'>Take a look!</a>

    <p>
        This is my first stab at a WebGL-based game framework.
        No sound or input, but it has a render and update loop.
        The big technical challenge here was being able to set a virtual resolution
        and palette, along with fullscreen capability.  Making the canvas fill the
        screen kept leading to smeared pixels due to unwanted smooth scaling.  I like my
        pixels jagged.  The solution I found was to first render to a framebuffer, then
        present that framebuffer to the canvas.  The palette and image data are merged
        together in a fragment shader.
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel conflicted about using the TWGL library.  It seems to be well-maintained,
        but since I'm working with 2D pixel graphics most of the functionality is probably
        unnecessary bloat.  I think I'll be slowly working the dependency out of my code
        in the coming weeks.

    <a href='games/sin_plasma.html'>Take a look!</a>

    <p>
        Demo #2 is just a tiny bit more involved.  My sinusoidal plasma algorithm is based on
        some C# code from years ago, that was based on a fragment shader from even further back.
        The code could run a lot faster if I put everything inside of the fragment shader, but
        doing it like this with pixel manipulation better suits my long-term goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're interested in seeing how this works, start with the onRender function's
        loop over the x- and y-coordinates, then see how some math is being done to
        combine the plasma_small and plasma_big results into a single color.  The hsv2rgb
        function isn't strictly necessary for this algorithm, but I found that it looks
        nicer than using just RGB.
